## Method

This scam aims to install malware on your PC which steals your metamask seed phrase and gives the scammer access to your wallets. The scammer often claims to have commissioned work but for whatever reason it is unfinished and they want you to finish it or they will offer up a file of assets they want you to rework in your artistic style. The scammer will hold a bit of a conversation about commissioning you, your rates and such but if you ask too much back about the job they will be quite persistent and say it is all in proposal inside the `zip` or `rar` file they sent you. Within the `zip` or `rar` file that the scammer sends to you may be files that look like `.docx`, `.PDF` or `.PSD` files but actually have double extensions such as `unfinished-work.psd.exe` or `brief.pdf.scr`. Attempting to open any such file will infect your PC with malware and transfer your seed phrase to the scammer who will drain your wallet.

## Key Points

- The scammer needs you to click on those files, so be suspicious of anyone who won't explain the commission or answer more questions in the DM.
- Turn on "Show File Extensions" in Windows Explorer and double check the final extension (`.xxx`) is what you think it is before clicking on any files.

## Useful Links

- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) is a free service owned by Google that lets you upload files or file archives (`zip`/`rar`) and scans them for malicious content.
